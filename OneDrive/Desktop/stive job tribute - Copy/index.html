      <h3>Biological and adoptive families</h3>

      <p class="para-graph">
        Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24,
        1955, the son of Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali (Arabic:
        عبد الفتاح الجندلي). He was adopted by Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul
        Reinhold Jobs.[2]

      <h3>Birth and early life</h3>

      <p>
        Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent
        the summer with his family in Homs. According to Jandali, Schieble
        deliberately did not involve him in the process: "Without telling me,
        Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without
        anyone knowing, including me."[12] Schieble gave birth to Jobs in San
        Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive couple for him
        that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",[13][14] but the couple
        later changed their mind.[13] Jobs was then placed with Paul and Clara
        Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to
        sign the adoption papers.[15] She then took the matter to court in an
        attempt to have her baby placed with a different family,[13] and only
        consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after the couple
        pledged to pay for the boy's college education.[16] Jobs' cousin, Bassma
        Al Jandaly, maintains that Jobs' birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.

    <p>
      Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist,[21]
      several other jobs,[22] and then "back to work as a machinist." Paul and
      Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957[23] and by 1959 the family
      had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California.[24]
      It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his
      son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics."[25] Jobs, meanwhile,
      admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything.
      If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he
      gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing
      cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."[25] By the time he was
      ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the
      engineers who lived in the neighborhood.[26][page needed] He had
      difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen
      by his classmates as a "loner."
